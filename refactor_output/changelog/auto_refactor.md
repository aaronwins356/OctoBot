# OctoBot Refactor Summary

## Security Enhancements
- Shared authentication via `octobot.security.auth_shared` applied to Flask and FastAPI.
- Dashboard approvals require compliant validation reports with coverage ≥ 90%.
- Connectors reject non-whitelisted domains before issuing requests.

## Reliability Upgrades
- Analyzer agent skips excluded directories and logs parse failures without crashing.
- Validator handles malformed JSON artefacts and keeps coverage values as fractions.
- Orchestrator utilises an instance-level event queue preventing cross-test leakage.

## Governance & Documentation
- `safe_write` funnels all persistence through law enforcement checks.
- README highlights the secure architecture and testing requirements.
- CI workflow proposal standardises Poetry-based installs and pytest coverage thresholds.
