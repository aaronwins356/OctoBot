# Human Approval Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing a proposal generated by an entrepreneur agent.

1. **Fetch Proposal Files**
   - Checkout a review branch as instructed by `brain approve-proposal <id>`.
   - Copy proposal files into your working tree.

2. **Static Checks**
   - Run `make lint` to execute Ruff static analysis.
   - Run `python -m laws.enforcement <path>` if reviewing new agents manually.

3. **Testing**
   - Run `make test` to execute the pytest suite.
   - Optionally run targeted tests relevant to the proposal.

4. **Security Review**
   - Inspect source for disallowed imports or system calls.
   - Confirm file writes stay inside allowed sandbox directories.
   - Ensure no network or credential handling is introduced.

5. **Audit Logs**
   - Inspect `logs/audit.log.jsonl` for entries referencing the proposal.
   - Verify SHA256 hashes match the files under review.

6. **Ledger Updates**
   - Run `python - <<'PY'` snippet to inspect balances:
     ```python
     from economy import ledger
     print(ledger.snapshot())
     ```
   - Confirm credit changes correspond to audited events.

7. **PR Preparation**
   - Craft a descriptive PR body summarising findings.
   - Request two maintainers for approval before merging.
   - Never enable auto-merge.

8. **Post-Merge**
   - After manual merge, archive proposal directory for records.

This process ensures human oversight remains central to any code evolution suggested by the AI Republic agents.
